## Description
The game consists in two player deploing a predefined number of ships onto a 10x10 grid. Once that all the ships have been deployed, players attack in turns the other player's ships and the first who sink the opponent fleet wins

## Installation
Start by cloning this repository on your PC, open a terminal and
```
git clone https://github.com/Bleznudd/battleship-tcf.git
```

Once that the download has finished cd into the directory
```
cd battleship-tcf
```

And run the Makefile with the command
```
make
```
> You can speed up compilation by adding the `-jN` option to make, where N is the number of contemporary jobs you want to process, in general is not recommanded to use a value higer than the number of cores of your CPU

You will find and executable file in the directory called **battleship-tcf**, start the game with
```
./battleship-tcf
```
### Note for NON ANSI terminal
If your terminal emulator does not support ANSI escape codes, which are used in this project, you may still want to play the game. Just replace the make command with
```
make -e DA=NOTANSI
```
> You can still add the `-jN` option mentioned above

### Note for Windows users
Windows prompt doeas not support ANSI escape code, so you will need to use the **NON ANSI** procedure. In addition you will need [GnuWin](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) or [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) to use the make command, because Windows does not provide native support for makefiles.
After that you will be able to play the game as mentioned above.
